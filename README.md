![alt text](https://5.imimg.com/data5/PI/FD/NK/SELLER-5866466/images-500x500.jpg "Logo")\
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

## Features
This AI model comes with 99% Accuracy, it can easily detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
