# Face-Mask-Detection
![alt text](https://5.imimg.com/data5/PI/FD/NK/SELLER-5866466/images-500x500.jpg "Logo")\
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

## Features
This AI model comes with 99% Accuracy, it can easily detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## How to Run the Model
For real time prediction you can run the file "Run.ipynb".\
Or you can create or modify CNN model in the file **Model** i.e "Mask_Detection.ipynb" to train the model. You can add or delete layers in MLP part of the model based on your data and results. Don't forget to save your model after each epoch.

## Frameworks Used
+ Python
+ Tensorflow
